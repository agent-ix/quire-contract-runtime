## Summary

Exact/QSV own value semantics, verified member/equality plans, unit/conversion facts and native charge schedules. Driver owns independent input/authority admission and canonical value encoding. RT owns bounded interpretation, association comparison, commit/rollback and retained results; source owns outcomes/history/event_position.

Frozen original RT #193 production 65bd26971bbf23a9bce4432ef459536fc1b75dcd and original integration #35 260cfc3df529e895be47a83ac002d753f1fd2aa4. This is the same independent reviewer, one batched pass over composite construction, Sequence/size/flatten/fold, native union/equality, Boolean native metering and entry dispatch since the scalar slice. Old scalar doc finding is already fixed at dbea2d5; its finding ownership is retained in the original artifact. No duplicate old finding is opened here. Repository guidance, code/Rust style references and applicable scoped spec methods were consulted. No source/test edits, Cargo/Kani/CBMC or heavy jobs were performed. No applicable AssuranceProfile was found.

Canonical construction orders record operands by native declaration, rejects incomplete/duplicate/foreign/optional members, checks each selected operand before later execution, then uses shared admitted-slot/composite retention. Tuple and union payloads preserve positional order. Sequence construction meters before each selected element; flatten preserves duplicate occurrence order; fold evaluates source then identity once, owns explicit accumulator/item bindings and uses continuation frames with charged retained projections. Static type equivalence is cached only for validated expression/type edges; dynamic membership remains native and bounded. Shared verified union members and CheckedEquality are retained, including conversions/enum/unit metadata; no label or comparison model is reconstructed. Boolean results now call shared retain_boolean after the selected lazy branch. Scratch reservations guard canonical slot count/bytes and live interpreter addresses; no arbitrary allocator OOM recovery is promised.

Entry dispatch compares all attached canonical association components and range before source entry execution. Input values receive native membership admission. Modular deltas handle widths 16 and 64 without a 64-bit shift; initial event delta is zero. Gap selects on_gap last, with the same input admission. State/baseline/progress commit only after a completed canonical Step; poll does not execute, and watermark does not move the event baseline. Watermark authority/assertion coverage is explicitly driver-owned; nonempty opaque bytes do not independently confer authority. Source invariants terminate subsequent input, ordinary input/resource failures do not. MonitorStep retains canonical Results and immutable Program qualification. invoke creates a fresh native Meter and clears frames, bindings, folds, projections and computed values on both success and failure. No concrete production logic defect was found in the frozen scope.

Evidence read from qualification-logs/titan-ir722/dispatch: whole monitor_program80/0 at9a48f47, supplemental terminal control1/0 and final dispatch6/0 at260cfc3; do not claim a whole81 run. Touched Clippy passes on the archived explicit INTERIM coherent cohort only. RT all-target/all-feature Clippy is supplied on Exact a305/QSV255. Restored committed IT candidate cohort reaches unchanged driverbd140 and fails six adoption errors; it is not green. Real temporal producer lowering/qualification, final own dependency-head long chain, full aggregate, external coverage acceptance and IEEE backend remain unqualified. IEEE evidence is source/compile-only, with no backend replay. FR-276/TC200 full feature acceptance is not credited. QSpec595 event_position and597 canonical atom_projection remain authoritative source-program semantics, not RT mirror statuses.

Plan completion: not assessed

## Verdict

Scoped method verdict: **PASS**. This is not full feature or merge acceptance.

## Frozen dispatch fix carry

Disposition verified at unchanged RT65bd26971bbf23a9bce4432ef459536fc1b75dcd / integration0d1bd5ad55e8df8ac088138c6328cbd27b823a47. Actual test diff and preserved logs show ten dispatch controls PASS and touched Clippy PASS ONLY on the explicitly archived interim lock. This is not a whole85 or current-cohort qualification claim. The separately preserved final IR953 dependency-head long-chain control passes100001nodes (61.13s test,63.78s command); that formerly owed narrow run is now evidenced. Candidate committed IT cohort still fails six unchanged driver API adoption errors. Accepted external RT coverage discharge remains unresolved; no expanded114 exception, producer/FR276/full-feature acceptance, final aggregate or IEEE backend claim is granted. No Cargo/backend runs or source/test edits by reviewer.

Boolean retained results use canonical constants rather than the computed arena; the new stopped fold executes IntegerAdd and supplies the computed-arena cleanup evidence. Together these controls establish the original scalar-specific recovery qualification. Existing lexical recovery remains fixed.

Current scoped method verdict: **PASS**. Overall merge/feature readiness remains conditional on the explicitly unresolved external gates.
