## Summary

Code and Rust review found no concrete production defect; a medium evidence gap remains for watermark/fold and scalar-native/computed same-machine recovery. Existing lexical re-entry evidence is now meaningful.

Frozen original RT #193 production 65bd26971bbf23a9bce4432ef459536fc1b75dcd and original integration #35 260cfc3df529e895be47a83ac002d753f1fd2aa4. This is the same independent reviewer, one batched pass over composite construction, Sequence/size/flatten/fold, native union/equality, Boolean native metering and entry dispatch since the scalar slice. Old scalar doc finding is already fixed at dbea2d5; its finding ownership is retained in the original artifact. No duplicate old finding is opened here. Repository guidance, code/Rust style references and applicable scoped spec methods were consulted. No source/test edits, Cargo/Kani/CBMC or heavy jobs were performed. No applicable AssuranceProfile was found.

Canonical construction orders record operands by native declaration, rejects incomplete/duplicate/foreign/optional members, checks each selected operand before later execution, then uses shared admitted-slot/composite retention. Tuple and union payloads preserve positional order. Sequence construction meters before each selected element; flatten preserves duplicate occurrence order; fold evaluates source then identity once, owns explicit accumulator/item bindings and uses continuation frames with charged retained projections. Static type equivalence is cached only for validated expression/type edges; dynamic membership remains native and bounded. Shared verified union members and CheckedEquality are retained, including conversions/enum/unit metadata; no label or comparison model is reconstructed. Boolean results now call shared retain_boolean after the selected lazy branch. Scratch reservations guard canonical slot count/bytes and live interpreter addresses; no arbitrary allocator OOM recovery is promised.

Entry dispatch compares all attached canonical association components and range before source entry execution. Input values receive native membership admission. Modular deltas handle widths 16 and 64 without a 64-bit shift; initial event delta is zero. Gap selects on_gap last, with the same input admission. State/baseline/progress commit only after a completed canonical Step; poll does not execute, and watermark does not move the event baseline. Watermark authority/assertion coverage is explicitly driver-owned; nonempty opaque bytes do not independently confer authority. Source invariants terminate subsequent input, ordinary input/resource failures do not. MonitorStep retains canonical Results and immutable Program qualification. invoke creates a fresh native Meter and clears frames, bindings, folds, projections and computed values on both success and failure. No concrete production logic defect was found in the frozen scope.

Evidence read from qualification-logs/titan-ir722/dispatch: whole monitor_program80/0 at9a48f47, supplemental terminal control1/0 and final dispatch6/0 at260cfc3; do not claim a whole81 run. Touched Clippy passes on the archived explicit INTERIM coherent cohort only. RT all-target/all-feature Clippy is supplied on Exact a305/QSV255. Restored committed IT candidate cohort reaches unchanged driverbd140 and fails six adoption errors; it is not green. Real temporal producer lowering/qualification, final own dependency-head long chain, full aggregate, external coverage acceptance and IEEE backend remain unqualified. IEEE evidence is source/compile-only, with no backend replay. FR-276/TC200 full feature acceptance is not credited. QSpec595 event_position and597 canonical atom_projection remain authoritative source-program semantics, not RT mirror statuses.

Plan completion: not assessed

## Verdict

Scoped method verdict: **CONDITIONAL**. This is not full feature or merge acceptance.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Summary | Refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | medium | The same-machine recursive event and gap retry controls prove lexical cleanup and reading rollback, but no stopped watermark retry/progress rollback or stopped fold re-entry control exists. Sequence native/scratch stops rebuild fresh monitors. The scalar computed/native-meter post-stop qualification also remains open: recursive dispatch performs no computed scalar/native meter charge before stopping. Add authentic same-machine controls without changing these criteria or claiming producer qualification. | tests/monitor_program.rs:dispatch retry and sequence stop controls |

## Frozen dispatch fix carry

Disposition verified at unchanged RT65bd26971bbf23a9bce4432ef459536fc1b75dcd / integration0d1bd5ad55e8df8ac088138c6328cbd27b823a47. Actual test diff and preserved logs show ten dispatch controls PASS and touched Clippy PASS ONLY on the explicitly archived interim lock. This is not a whole85 or current-cohort qualification claim. The separately preserved final IR953 dependency-head long-chain control passes100001nodes (61.13s test,63.78s command); that formerly owed narrow run is now evidenced. Candidate committed IT cohort still fails six unchanged driver API adoption errors. Accepted external RT coverage discharge remains unresolved; no expanded114 exception, producer/FR276/full-feature acceptance, final aggregate or IEEE backend claim is granted. No Cargo/backend runs or source/test edits by reviewer.

Boolean retained results use canonical constants rather than the computed arena; the new stopped fold executes IntegerAdd and supplies the computed-arena cleanup evidence. Together these controls establish the original scalar-specific recovery qualification. Existing lexical recovery remains fixed.

### Additional findings from gap clarification

Original review rows are retained; these specific omissions were identified before the fix and are recorded here with their dispositions.

| ID | Severity | Summary | Refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FND-002 | medium | The original context refusal test changes only clock_binding; independent package/clause/subject/occurrence/counter/unit/width/profile/order comparisons lack direct controls. | tests/monitor_program.rs |
| FND-003 | medium | The original watermark regression test does not exercise refusal of a foreign progress_context. | tests/monitor_program.rs |
| FND-004 | medium | The original Program pointer assertion does not directly distinguish original Results retention after preparation drops or foreign-plan qualification. | tests/monitor_program.rs |

### Dispositions round1

| FND | outcome | reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | fixed | The stopped watermark30 preserves committed10; same monitor/budget accepts20 then refuses19. The500-item fold stops on ScratchElements64 and the same machine/budget then computes three-item sum6. Recursive dispatch exhausts native ResultUnits20 after repeated Boolean retention, then the same machine/budget completes later inputs. The fold also populates computed Integer values, so recovery covers both computed storage and native Meter reset. |
| FND-002 | fixed | Ten independent one-component mismatches assert exact refusal plus unchanged State/baseline; they include package,clause,subject,occurrence,clock,counter,unit,width,profile,order. |
| FND-003 | fixed | Foreign progress_context refuses with ProgressContext and leaves State unchanged; valid event follows on the same monitor. |
| FND-004 | fixed | Weak original Results/program owners survive monitor/preparation drops, match returned canonical owners, and expire on final step drop; two separately selected subjects retain distinguishable Program associations. |

Current scoped method verdict: **PASS**. Overall merge/feature readiness remains conditional on the explicitly unresolved external gates.

## Final native evidence carry

Final non-proof RT evidence carry at ad0665ee4120c7efb9ee506ae2ec468f08ebce93: production source remains65bd269 unchanged; only reviewed SRs and merged QSV3129 lock selection differ. The unchanged native test aggregate passes105/0/0ignored across27suites, including both exact-panic controls (real retained-call no-panic probe and injected-panic rejection). Preserved Make fmt-check/lint/test-features/doc/msrv/size/deny/deny-mutations logs pass; fourteen feature configurations, linked footprint973bytes and panic_references0. This is evidence for the RT native lock only, not final compatible integration qualification. Previously supplied own final IR953100001-node long-chain pass and all specific local control fixes remain credited. No new production review or source edit and no Cargo/Kani/backend execution by reviewer.

Whole-PR strict coverage is151unbacked/0contradicted against remeasured baseline114/0:37introduced rows,0removed, equal multiplicity explicitly compared. They span constructor through dispatch (interfaces002..012 plus FR276AC11; interface003AC3 is locally backed). The thirteen findings in this batch are only its newest interface009..012 rows, not the whole-PR delta. Their unresolved external discharge remains FAIL; completion of local controls does not compute accepted cross-repository discharge, and the baseline114 exception does not authorize the37. No blanket exception inferred. Compatible integration cohort still has driver adoption failures; actual temporal producer qualification, full FR276/TC200 acceptance and IEEE proof/backend remain held. Native green is not all mandatory gates green.

Current method verdict: **PASS**. Overall merge readiness remains **CONDITIONAL** on the recorded holds.
