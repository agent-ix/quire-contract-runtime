## Summary

Reviewed the frozen construction diff, public API, error paths and criterion/test bindings.

Frozen head: 4da072fad208ae36627cdc435408aa3c7bd2bfe2; base: 66eb9d8362e63d12e81f158abd2fae8e51dd561e.

## Verdict

**CONDITIONAL** — Findings require disposition.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Summary | Refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | medium | The ownership control checks only on_gap and literal operation shape; it never asserts the retained init/on_event/on_watermark associations or literal contents, so loss or substitution of those retained values can pass the AC-1 control. | tests/monitor_program.rs:270-307 |
| FND-002 | medium | The invalid-edge control mutates only a function body address and duplicate function keys; no test exercises duplicate expression locations or invalid Call/If child edges, leaving the expression-arena refusal promises unverified. | tests/monitor_program.rs:322-353 |

## Coverage

Plan completion: not assessed

No applicable AssuranceProfile found. Source, tests, public contract and upstream QSpec FR-487 at the supplied revision were inspected. Supplied evidence: nine focused controls pass; all-target/all-feature Clippy and fmt pass; changed spec validation passes with native type-resolution warnings. No Cargo or Kani commands run by this reviewer. Full make ci remains owed after review. No target-memory proof is claimed. Optional gap semantic review was not separately invoked. EARS is inapplicable: no new FR/NFR/StR requirement statement. Risk/complexity, security and criterion-strength lenses were not selected for this bounded interface addition.

## Examined scope

```yaml
scope:
- id: interface-002-AC-1
  path: spec/monitor/functional/interface-002-monitor-program.md
  role: examined
  excerpt: After construction consumes the preparation parts and one Rc owner drops,
    another owner retains the complete root key with nested operand keys, selection
    bytes, all four entry associations, literal bodies and shared nominal declarations.
    Invalid arena lookups return absent. No monitor execution credit is granted by
    this construction control.
- id: interface-002-AC-2
  path: spec/monitor/functional/interface-002-monitor-program.md
  role: examined
  excerpt: Missing or mistyped on_gap, invalid counter width, a gap outside the declared
    width, negative uncertainty and a tick unit under another dimension yield the
    typed construction refusal before any entry executes; width64 with maximum gap
    u64::MAX remains representable. Activation capacity zero and a positive value
    above u64::MAX remain retained exactly, while a negative value refuses without
    a host-width truncation.
- id: interface-002-AC-3
  path: spec/monitor/functional/interface-002-monitor-program.md
  role: examined
  excerpt: Duplicate source locations, invalid expression edges, direct expression
    cycles including unreachable arena nodes, and a reachable argument of another
    function refuse with their distinct typed codes. A finite shared subexpression
    and distinct inline body paths under the same source node remain admissible; a
    20,000-level shared inline arena validates on a 512 KiB native stack without recursive
    graph descent.
- id: interface-002-AC-4
  path: spec/monitor/functional/interface-002-monitor-program.md
  role: examined
  excerpt: Two compatible entry roles may reference the same retained function; construction
    does not add a distinct-function premise to FR-487.
- id: src/lib.rs
  path: src/lib.rs
  role: examined
  excerpt: //!
- id: src/monitor/mod.rs
  path: src/monitor/mod.rs
  role: examined
  excerpt: //! Owned executable monitor programs (FR-276).
- id: src/monitor/program.rs
  path: src/monitor/program.rs
  role: examined
  excerpt: //! The single retained executable representation, independent of compiler
    storage.
- id: src/monitor/validation.rs
  path: src/monitor/validation.rs
  role: examined
  excerpt: //! Executable integrity checks; source-language admission remains upstream.
- id: tests/monitor_program.rs
  path: tests/monitor_program.rs
  role: examined
  excerpt: //! Construction controls; these do not qualify monitor execution or the
    producer handoff.
- id: spec/core/functional/interface-001-runtime-api.md
  path: spec/core/functional/interface-001-runtime-api.md
  role: examined
  excerpt: 'id: interface_001'
- id: FR-276
  path: spec/monitor/functional/FR-276-consume-timed-monitor-plan.md
  role: context_only
  excerpt: The runtime uses the capacity supplied by QSL rather than deriving a second
    formula.
