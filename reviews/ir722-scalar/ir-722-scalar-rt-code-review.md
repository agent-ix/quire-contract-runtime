## Summary

No concrete scalar runtime bug found. The frozen API-doc omission is recorded then verified fixed at dbea2d5; same-Machine evidence remains deferred.

Frozen scalar source on original RT193 f3927c041579b7ae678f0c431e8b5127ce98a318 and integration35 5a51d1dcca86f98f762a6726e244c0be2f75e67b. The later interface003-only documentation fix dbea2d55b7a925010a0c1bf709740ca034eb2756 is included for disposition; constructor spec/production continuation is excluded. Read frozen Git snapshots, repository guidance, Rust/code review and selected scoped interface methods. No worktree source edits, Cargo/heavy/proof jobs, merge/closure or permission actions performed. No applicable AssuranceProfile found.

No concrete arithmetic/order/type/ownership defect was found. Binary child frames are pushed right then left, hence execute left first; scalar handling pops right then left and delegates exactly to shared evaluate_integer_arithmetic/order_numbers. Integer/Int inputs and arithmetic result annotations are checked; ordering requires Boolean. The declared Int result interval is forwarded to the native operation. Native Meter is created once per invocation with required explicit ScalarLimits and reused across selected operations, including helpers; no host-width arithmetic or private numeric semantics appear.

Completed integers move into canonical Value storage and are addressed by a private append-only computed arena. Computed/projection/binding/argument/operand addresses all participate in scratch/native live-element accounting and clear after invoke; a canonical composite result is retained first. Native Boolean order results use existing canonical constants. Incomplete retains LimitKind, exact Integer next_charge and original native outcome/charge point; refusal/undefined retain native cause and source as Scalar invariant evidence. No partial scalar becomes a value or temporal outcome. Resource boxing and non-Copy exact requested fields are explicit public-shape changes; no fallback budget/default is invented. RefCell denial state is only borrowed after synchronous native reservation callbacks return.

Eight scalar controls cover independently authored >128-bit decimal expectations, twelve ordering rows, bounded-domain refusal, invalid annotations, native shortage/source/charge evidence, cumulative result units, inactive scalar branches, left-first native failure and computed scratch. Preserved whole monitor_program target has 52 passing tests and touched Clippy ONLY on the archived interim cohort. RT all-target/all-feature Clippy and three existing native controls pass on current Exact a3052598 / QSV 25535387. Restored committed cohort, our final dependency-head long chain, producer, external coverage acceptance and final aggregate remain unqualified. Same-Machine cleanup after stop remains explicitly open until dispatch. Full phase 2/event/watermark/gap/FR-276 remains unfinished; IEEE has NO backend replay credit.

Plan completion: not assessed

## Verdict

Initial scoped verdict: **CONDITIONAL**. Current broader readiness remains CONDITIONAL; gap-analysis remains FAIL for unresolved acceptance.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Summary | Refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | medium | The stopped-invocation/later-execution clause remains unqualified: scalar scratch/resource controls rebuild a fresh Machine after failure, so they do not prove that one stopped Machine clears computed values and cumulative state before re-entry. Keep this known clause open until entry-dispatch controls; no API widening or fabricated RT identity fixture is requested. | tests/monitor_program.rs:scalar stop controls |
| FND-002 | medium | The frozen initializer contract enumerates StepBudget without its new required scalar: ScalarLimits member, while the scalar contract and public Rust type require it. Update that owned budget description so it does not direct callers to an incomplete initializer shape. | spec/monitor/functional/interface-003-monitor-executor.md:87-89 at f3927c04 |

## Dispositions

| FND | outcome | reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | deferred | The existing IR-722 dispatch work retains same-Machine cleanup-after-stop qualification. Current public build controls use fresh machines; no full AC-3 credit, acceptance narrowing, API widening or fake semantic-identity fixture is granted. |
| FND-002 | fixed | Verified interface003 budget shape and native-stop prose at dbea2d5; source unchanged. |

The documentation fix explicitly adds required scalar limits, per-invocation/cumulative native accounting, zero ceilings, exact requested units and ScalarFailure evidence. Other constructor ancestry/source changes are outside this carry.

```yaml
dispositions:
- fnd: FND-001
  outcome: deferred
  reason: The existing IR-722 dispatch work retains same-Machine cleanup-after-stop
    qualification. Current public build controls use fresh machines; no full AC-3
    credit, acceptance narrowing, API widening or fake semantic-identity fixture is
    granted.
- fnd: FND-002
  outcome: fixed
  after_excerpt: 'contains `work: u64`, required `scalar: quire_exact::ScalarLimits`,

    `stack_frames: usize`, `scratch_elements: usize` and `scratch_bytes: usize`;

    zero is a real zero ceiling, including each native scalar counter.'
```

Current method verdict after the documented disposition: **CONDITIONAL**. All broader qualification blockers remain explicit.

## Dispatch carry disposition

The earlier scalar API-doc fix remains fixed. New recursive dispatch is relevant but does not yet prove scalar computed/native-meter recovery; preserve that existing finding ownership rather than duplicate it in the new review.

| FND | outcome | reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | deferred | The new same-Machine recursive dispatch control qualifies lexical/projection cleanup, but executes no computed scalar/native meter charge before stopping. Scalar-specific stopped-computed/native-meter recovery remains unqualified pending authentic dispatch control on the same open IR-722; no AC narrowing or fresh-machine substitution. |
| FND-002 | fixed | The earlier scalar API-doc fix remains fixed. New recursive dispatch is relevant but does not yet prove scalar computed/native-meter recovery; preserve that existing finding ownership rather than duplicate it in the new review. |

```yaml
dispositions:
- fnd: FND-001
  outcome: deferred
  reason: The new same-Machine recursive dispatch control qualifies lexical/projection
    cleanup, but executes no computed scalar/native meter charge before stopping.
    Scalar-specific stopped-computed/native-meter recovery remains unqualified pending
    authentic dispatch control on the same open IR-722; no AC narrowing or fresh-machine
    substitution.

  after_excerpt: 'contains `work: u64`, required `scalar: quire_exact::ScalarLimits`,

    `stack_frames: usize`, `scratch_elements: usize` and `scratch_bytes: usize`;

```

## Dispatch scalar recovery disposition

Disposition verified at unchanged RT65bd26971bbf23a9bce4432ef459536fc1b75dcd / integration0d1bd5ad55e8df8ac088138c6328cbd27b823a47. Actual test diff and preserved logs show ten dispatch controls PASS and touched Clippy PASS ONLY on the explicitly archived interim lock. This is not a whole85 or current-cohort qualification claim. The separately preserved final IR953 dependency-head long-chain control passes100001nodes (61.13s test,63.78s command); that formerly owed narrow run is now evidenced. Candidate committed IT cohort still fails six unchanged driver API adoption errors. Accepted external RT coverage discharge remains unresolved; no expanded114 exception, producer/FR276/full-feature acceptance, final aggregate or IEEE backend claim is granted. No Cargo/backend runs or source/test edits by reviewer.

The native ResultUnits stop/retry control and stopped IntegerAdd fold jointly cover native-meter and computed-storage recovery on the same machines/budgets. Boolean values themselves remain canonical constants.

```yaml
dispositions:
- fnd: FND-001
  outcome: fixed
  after_excerpt: budget.scalar.result_units = 20;
  reason: The stopped watermark30 preserves committed10; same monitor/budget accepts20
    then refuses19. The500-item fold stops on ScratchElements64 and the same machine/budget
    then computes three-item sum6. Recursive dispatch exhausts native ResultUnits20
    after repeated Boolean retention, then the same machine/budget completes later
    inputs. The fold also populates computed Integer values, so recovery covers both
    computed storage and native Meter reset.
- fnd: FND-002
  outcome: fixed
  after_excerpt: 'contains `work: u64`, required `scalar: quire_exact::ScalarLimits`,

    `stack_frames: usize`, `scratch_elements: usize` and `scratch_bytes: usize`;

    zero is a real zero ceiling, including each native scalar counter.'
```

Current scalar code/evidence method verdict: **PASS**; broader acceptance remains conditional.
