"""Drive the official change-assurance chain over already-produced results (FR-005).

Four things this file deliberately is not.

It is not a producer. It never runs a test, a proof, a compiler, or a linker.
Every input it reads was written by `make assurance-inputs`, and if one is absent
it says so and names that target. A driver that can produce its own inputs is a
driver that can produce a green run out of nothing.

It is not an envelope. Quoin's packaged FR-063 record, FR-064 attestation and
FR-065 receipt schemas are the shapes. This file projects
`assurance/change-assurance.json` into the record body Quoin requires and derives
nothing beyond the digests that file's own `derived_fields` names.

It is not a verdict. It runs `quoin` and reports what `quoin` said. Where a
scenario expects a refusal, the refusal is the expected result and the run is
green because the tool refused, not because the tool agreed.

It is not a retention store. Nothing is written under `evidence/`, nothing is
committed, and the Quoin store it uses lives under `target/`, which is ignored.

Exit status: 0 when every scenario, control and probe matched, 1 when one did
not, 2 on a usage or environment error — which is a different fact from a
mismatch and gets its own code.
