## Summary

quoin advise ran on both frozen snapshots. New interface criteria are catalog-inconclusive; executable Test controls are chosen by reviewer judgment because their outcomes are concrete. Independent truth rows and selected/unselected right-recursion controls discriminate logic/laziness. This does not convert interim-cohort results to committed-cohort qualification.

Frozen original PR193 Boolean amendment af4c3d8effd378cac9cd953b01404aee6f118981 (production Boolean commit d7222bd) over lexical 2ec49a0, and integration PR35 7fcff282ce80a05527bcd4b3493837a61f74f12d over 742bff7. Intermediate PR195/36 are superseded/closed, not merged. Read frozen Git snapshots, repository guidance, code-review/Rust rules and selected scoped interface methods. No worktree source edits, Cargo/heavy/proof jobs, merge/closure or permission actions performed. No applicable AssuranceProfile found.

Source review found no concrete Boolean runtime/type/cache/resource defect. The constructor enforces Boolean annotations for operation results and every operand; graph traversal/ownership includes all Boolean edges. BooleanLeft evaluates left first, returns the selected canonical left operand on short circuit, or schedules only the selected right continuation; BooleanRight checks its dynamic Boolean kind. Not selects one of two immutable static shared Value::Boolean constants through a private operand selector. This adds no parallel semantic Value/type/outcome enum, source identity, callback, State/root field or public carrier. Canonical Boolean type facts are established by construction and existing conformance of Call/Local/If edges; the private continuations preserve them. Selected failures remain typed resources/invariants rather than false results.

Supplied cohort-specific evidence: four Boolean controls cover both unary and eight binary authored truth rows, all four lazy recursive-right cases, wrong annotations and work/stack/scratch stops. A separate tight recursive-shadow control stops at four live slots (spent 4, request 1) and succeeds at five with outer now=99. The whole monitor_program target has 34 passing tests and touched integration Clippy passes ONLY on the preserved interim old-leaf lock with current RT source. RT all-target/all-feature Clippy passes on Exact a3052598 / QSV 25535387. The committed integration cohort is not qualified. Owner-reported final-IR 100001 control after IR827/829 is not our owed final dependency-head long-chain run. QSL1463/2106 real-producer qualification remains pending; driver selection work is an implementation responsibility, not an upstream-spec blocker. IEEE 977f279b evidence is source/compile-only; no CBMC replay is credited.

Lexical preparation prose now correctly says linear, matching the fixed construction passes. The tight shadow control resolves that portion of the prior AC-4 evidence finding; same-Machine subsequent-invocation cleanup remains unqualified until entry-dispatch controls exist. Full AC-4 is not narrowed or credited. Remaining ordinary operations, event/watermark/gap dispatch, FR-276 acceptance, external coverage acceptance and final aggregate remain unfinished/unresolved. This pass grants only scoped Boolean component review.

Plan completion: not assessed

## Verdict

**PASS** — No defects in this scoped method; this is not aggregate or full-feature acceptance.
