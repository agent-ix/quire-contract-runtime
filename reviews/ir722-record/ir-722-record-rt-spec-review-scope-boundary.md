## Summary

RT owns physical address metadata and ordinary projection; shared MemberId, native declarations and membership own identity/type meaning. Only required node-owned fields are claimed. Optional/effective member semantics and real producer lowering remain separate; no host callback or source parser appears.

Frozen record capability on original RT193 operations 1b7ad105c008ef58282b2b2b36285b548bfbb1e5 over tuple source 4430b60; integration35 55a53605667f81e854c8843a6ff3742427640d27 over 6c38070. Existing trailing review files are historical context; later capability amendments are excluded. Read actual frozen Git snapshots, repository guidance, Rust/code review and selected scoped interface methods. No worktree source edits, Cargo/heavy/proof jobs, merge/closure or permission actions performed. No applicable AssuranceProfile found.

No concrete record runtime/index/ownership defect found. Operation retains the shared MemberId, restricted explicitly to required node-owned record members. Constructor checks receiver annotation/owner/shape, then Fields::prepare groups requests by MemberId owner, scans only requested declarations, sorts borrowed field references while retaining original positions, and stores a private expression-indexed position. The locked shared MemberId Ord is owner-first, validating the grouped-prefix partition assumption. The public member identity is never replaced by a slot ordinal, and the RT does not construct a MemberId or source key.

Exact declaration reads use the prepared slot without a field scan. Dynamic reads first use the shared nominal relation and then resolve the original field identifier in actual declaration order, charging before every inspected field; their selected slot type uses existing shared native facts or bounded admission. Required/optional presence is not guessed, effective-model member owners remain unsupported by this slice, and absent physical values produce typed projection invariants. Shared tuple projection cells retain the original Arc owner; root canonical results are retained before temporary cells clear, scratch accounting includes every retained address, and no selected subtree is copied. Dynamic record behavior still needs the recorded control.

The four record controls cover declared-name versus physical-order selection, Arc owner counts, owner/member/shape/result/presence refusal, and tight scratch. A separate tuple control now covers a distinct actual tuple declaration with a test-owned native supertype edge, plus Int[0,10]→Integer bounded slot admission (work 4 preserves native admission failure; a generous budget succeeds). Keys and declaration shapes are genuinely QSL-emitted/strict-IR-read; the native supertype edges are explicitly test-owned and NOT asserted emitted by QSL. This is RT branch diagnostics, not producer relation or temporal qualification.

Supplied evidence: four record controls and the full monitor_program target of 43 passing tests, plus touched Clippy, pass ONLY on the archived interim cohort with current RT source. RT all-target/all-feature Clippy passes on Exact a3052598 / QSV 25535387. The restored committed new cohort remains unqualified due to documented driver adoption blockers. Our final dependency-head long chain, real producer, external coverage acceptance and final aggregate remain owed. IEEE has NO backend/CBMC replay credit. Full phase 2/event/watermark/gap acceptance and same-Machine lexical cleanup-after-stop remain open.

Plan completion: not assessed

## Verdict

**PASS** — No additional defect in this method; this is not aggregate or producer acceptance.
